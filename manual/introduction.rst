Vorstellung von MetaModels
==========================

Was ist MetaModels?
-------------------

MetaModels are data models you can configure in the Contao Backend.
Every MetaModel consists of various attributes of certain data types
(attribute types are available as extensions and get registered upon
installation).

To present the data on the screen (i.e. website, RSS feed, etc.), you
define render settings for the MetaModel which define how the various
attribute output shall look like (image sizes, use lightboxes, etc.).

Filtering data in list views needs configuration of filter settings.
Filter settings are a very complex topic, as they can be nested (AND/OR
conditions i.e.) and be of various nature.

History of MetaModels
---------------------

Metamodels started out as the next generation of the famous Catalog extension.

As the Catalog extension was growing too complex too maintain and most
support for extendability was rather hacky, we decided it was time to
take everything we learned during the development of Catalog 1 and
Catalog 2 and then start from scratch to provide you with Catalog 3
which should be even more flexible and very easy to extend with own
functionality.

As development did go on nicely, we realized that an easy migration from
Catalog to the new version will not very likely be possible both in
implementation and learning curve but that this will be a very own and
unique extension resembling only of the name with it's ancestor.
Therefore we rebranded everything as "MetaModels" and now they are the
replacement for the famous Catalog extension.
